# Requirements Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive requirements for the leveraged DeFi strategy system. Requirements are organized into logical categories to facilitate development, testing, and maintenance.

## Requirements Structure

- **FR-003**: Command-Based Execution
- **FR-004**: Flash Loan Management
- **FR-005**: Multi-Token Support

### [Technical Requirements](technical-requirements.md)
Implementation details and technical constraints:
- **TR-001**: Contract Architecture
- **TR-002**: NAV Calculation
- **TR-003**: Child Strategy Interface
- **TR-004**: Command System Implementation
- **TR-005**: Rebalancing Architecture
- **TR-006**: Flash Loan Implementation
- **TR-007**: Error Handling and Atomicity

### [Security Requirements](security-requirements.md)
Security measures and risk mitigation:
- **SR-001**: Access Control
- **SR-002**: Invariant Protection
- **SR-003**: Flash Loan Security
- **SR-004**: Command System Security
- **SR-005**: Oracle Security
- **SR-006**: Upgrade Security

### [Performance Requirements](performance-requirements.md)
Performance targets and optimization guidelines:
- **PR-001**: Gas Optimization
- **PR-002**: Execution Performance
- **PR-003**: Scalability
- **PR-004**: Liquidity Management
- **PR-005**: Oracle Performance
- **PR-006**: Off-Chain Performance
- **PR-007**: Network Performance
- **PR-008**: Monitoring and Metrics

## Requirement Traceability

Each requirement is tagged with a unique identifier (FR-XXX, TR-XXX, SR-XXX, PR-XXX) to enable:
- Cross-referencing between requirements and ADRs
- Mapping requirements to implementation components
- Testing coverage tracking
- Change impact analysis

## Relationship to ADRs

Requirements serve as the foundation for Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):
1. **Requirements First**: Start with understanding what needs to be built
2. **Architecture Decisions**: ADRs document how requirements will be satisfied
3. **Implementation**: Code implements the architecture following ADR decisions

See the [ADR directory](../adr/) for architectural decisions that implement these requirements.

## Contributing

When modifying requirements:
1. Ensure requirement IDs remain stable (don't renumber existing requirements)
2. Add new requirements with the next available ID in the appropriate category
3. Update this README if adding new requirement categories
4. Review impact on existing ADRs and implementation code
5. Update traceability documentation as needed

## Review Process

Requirements should be reviewed and updated:
- When new features are planned
- After significant architectural changes
- During security audits
- Based on user feedback and operational experience
- At regular intervals to ensure accuracy and completeness
