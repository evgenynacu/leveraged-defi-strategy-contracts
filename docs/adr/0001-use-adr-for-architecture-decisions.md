# ADR-0001: Use Architecture Decision Records

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need to document architectural decisions for the project. It's important to preserve the context of decisions for:
- New team members
- Future architecture changes
- Decision auditing
- Avoiding repeated discussions of resolved issues
- better AI tools support

## Decision
We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADR) to document all significant architectural decisions.

Format:
- Numbering: 0001, 0002, etc.
- Location: `docs/adr/`
- Template: standard ADR template
- Statuses: Proposed → Accepted → [Deprecated/Superseded]

## Consequences
### Positive
- Transparency of architectural decisions
- Preservation of context and rationale
- Simplified onboarding for new developers and AI tools
- Ability to review decisions with full context

### Negative
- Additional time required for documentation
- Need to keep documents up to date

### Neutral
- All architectural decisions must go through ADR process
